# Todo List App

A simple and responsive Todo List application built with React and Tailwind CSS.  
This app allows you to add, check/uncheck, edit, and delete your daily tasks. All todos are saved in your browser's local storage, so your list persists even after refreshing the page.

- **Mark as Complete:** Check the box to mark a task as done (adds a line-through).
- **Edit Tasks:** Click "Edit" to update an existing task.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks you no longer need.
- **Persistent Storage:** Todos are saved in local storage automatically.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Animated UI:** Smooth transitions and hover effects using Tailwind CSS.
